# Lab Inventory & Access (P0.1)

## Host & Hypervisor
- Host OS: Linux Mint
- Hardware: i7-7700, 32GB RAM
- Hypervisor: KVM/libvirt + virt-manager
- Virtual network: bridged LAN via `br0`

## Network (Sanitized for public repo)
- Network mode: KVM bridged LAN (`br0`) for LAN-reachable VMs
- Private addressing: RFC1918 (details masked)
- IP management: DHCP with reservations for host bridge and lab VMs (DCs/jumpbox)
- Required egress: HTTPS 443 to Microsoft Entra endpoints
- Remote access model:
  - Admin workstation → RDP to `JPW-ADM-01` (jumpbox)
  - Admin workstation → SSH to Mint host (restricted to admin workstation IP)

## Systems Inventory (Planned → Built)
| Name | Role | Domain/Forest | OS | vCPU/RAM/Disk | Network | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| JPW-ADM-01 | Jumpbox/Admin workstation | Workgroup (initially) | Windows Server 2025 Eval (Desktop Experience) | 2 / 6GB / 100GB | br0 (DHCP reservation) | Built |
| CORP-DC1 | Root DC + DNS | corp.jpw.lab | Windows Server 2025 Eval | 2 / 4GB / 80GB | br0 | Planned |
| EAST-DC1 | Child DC + DNS | east.corp.jpw.lab | Windows Server 2025 Eval | 2 / 4GB / 80GB | br0 | Planned |
| WEST-DC1 | Child DC + DNS | west.corp.jpw.lab | Windows Server 2025 Eval | 2 / 4GB / 80GB | br0 | Planned |
| ATS-DC1 | ATS DC + DNS | ats.jpw.lab | Windows Server 2025 Eval | 2 / 4GB / 80GB | br0 | Planned |
| SYNC-01 | Cloud Sync agent | (later) | Windows Server 2025 Eval | 2 / 4GB / 80GB | br0 | Optional |

## Notes / Constraints
- Objective: VMs reachable from anywhere on LAN, securely, via jumpbox access model.
- Evidence: P0.1 screenshots stored under `exports/Evidence-Pack-v1.0/Phase-0/`.
