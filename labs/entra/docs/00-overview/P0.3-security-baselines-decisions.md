# Security Baselines — Decisions (Phase 0) v1.0
Effective date: 2026-01-28  
Owner: Jacob Williams  
Scope: JPW Identity Lab (Microsoft Entra ID + hybrid multi-forest AD) aligned to HIPAA/SOC 2 control intent

---

## 1) Administrative Tier Model (MVP)

**Objective:** Reduce attack paths by separating privileged identities and limiting where they can sign in.

### Tier definitions (lab scope)
- **Tier 0 (Control Plane)**
  - AD: Domain Controllers; forest/domain admin control plane; trust configuration
  - Entra: privileged directory roles (e.g., Global Admin, Privileged Role Admin, Security Admin, Conditional Access Admin)
  - Emergency access: `bg-*` accounts
  - Identity infrastructure components (e.g., Entra Cloud Sync agent server if treated as control plane, PKI if added later)
- **Tier 1 (Server Administration)**
  - Member servers and workloads (e.g., `SYNC-01`, app servers, management servers)
  - Server admin/operator identities for those systems
- **Tier 2 (User / Endpoint)**
  - Standard user accounts and end-user workstations
  - Non-privileged daily operations

### Account separation rules
- Each admin has:
  - **1 daily-use account** (Tier 2)
  - **1+ admin accounts** for privileged tasks only (`t0-*`, `t1-*`, `t2-*`)
- Tier 0 accounts:
  - **No** email/Teams (lab policy)
  - Do **not** sign into Tier 2 endpoints
- Privileged prefixes (`bg-`, `t0-`, `t1-`, `t2-`, `svc-`, `gmsa-`) are excluded from broad dynamic group membership.

### Implementation notes (when this becomes real)
- Tiered OUs and baseline GPO scaffolding: **Phase 1**
- Tier 0 logon restrictions / deny logon policies: **Phase 2**
- Entra privileged roles enforced via PIM (JIT): **Phase 6**

## 2) Break-Glass (Emergency Access) Requirements

**Objective:** Ensure tenant recovery and admin access continuity, while monitoring emergency access usage.

### Requirements
- Create **two** cloud-only emergency accounts:
  - Naming: `bg-jpw-01`, `bg-jpw-02`
- Accounts are:
  - Excluded from Conditional Access only as required for emergency availability; exclusions are explicit, documented, and monitored
  - Not used for day-to-day administration
  - Protected by long passwords and monitored; not used for daily administration

### Storage & access process (lab)
- Credential storage: Bitwarden; encrypted offline backup stored on external drive; access recorded in change log
- Access process: Single-person lab; credentials stored in password manager; usage documented in change log
- Evidence rule: never screenshot passwords, recovery codes, QR codes, or keys.

### Monitoring expectation
- Any sign-in by a break-glass account should generate an alert/notification (lab-simulated acceptable).

### Implementation notes
- Create + test accounts: **Phase 3**
- Break-glass drill with CA live: **Phase 9**

---

## 3) Logging, Retention, and Evidence Handling

**Objective:** Maintain an audit trail of identity changes and access activity and produce evidence packs suitable for HIPAA/SOC 2-style control verification.

### Log sources (minimum)
- **Microsoft Entra ID**
  - Sign-in logs (user/admin sign-in activity)
  - Audit logs (directory + policy changes)
- **PIM**
  - Role activation and audit events (who elevated, when, why)

### Retention + Evidence Strategy (lab)
- Tenant log retention: 30–90 days (lab target)
- Evidence artifacts: stored indefinitely in repo evidence packs:
  - `exports/Evidence-Pack-v1.0/Phase-X/`

### Evidence handling rules (public repo sanitization)
- Do not commit: public IPs (IPv4/IPv6), MAC addresses, DUID/IAID, secrets/tokens, recovery codes, QR codes, router WAN details.
- Mask private IPv4 (example: `192.168.1.xx`).
- Evidence filenames follow: `PX.Y-<short-description>.png`

### Implementation notes
- Optional central logging (Log Analytics/SIEM): **Phase 8**
- Evidence pack structure and recurring checklist: **Phase 8**
